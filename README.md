# Rust Programming Language

This is a threaded server client model that allows two instances of a todo list...


Execute the following:

cargo build       #This builds the rust program
./run_todo.sh     #This runs the program (first creating the server)


Then in a separate terminal run
./run_todo.sh     #Now that the server is running it will start a client

Then in yet a third terminal run
./run_todo.sh
